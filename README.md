# CE462-Project-3
Cantilever Walls

This program will be completed in Python and aims to acomplish the following:

1. Allow the user to input the shear strength parameters of the soil (cohesion = c for clay and angle of internal friction Ï• for granular soil), as well as the height of the sheet pile.
2. Check if the height of the sheet pile exceeds the cantilever limit (6 meters).
3. Compute the required embedment depth and maximum moment for the sheet pile.
4. Plot the lateral earth pressure distribution.
5. Perform a sensitivity analysis on the shear strength parameters, altering them within a reasonable range to observe how the embedment depth and maximum moment are affected.
6. Plot the results of the sensitivity analysis.
   
For extra fun the program will aslo do the following:

1. Plot the displacement of the sheet pile with depth using the method presented in the NAVFAC manual 
2. Include the effects of groundwater flow 
   
Assumptions and methodologies:
- This program covers a scenario where the sheetpiles penetrate granular soils and penetrate a clay layer
- For the lateral earth pressure calculations, the Rankine Theory is utilized
- Unit Weight of the soil is assumed to be ######
- The value of Ka of the soil is assumed to be ####
